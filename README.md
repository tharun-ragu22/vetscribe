# VetScribe Assistant

A Windows system-tray app for veterinary exam rooms. Press a hotkey to record
the conversation, get an AI-generated SOAP note, and have it typed directly
into AVImark — with a safety net when AVImark isn't in focus, and automatic
recovery if the AI backend is temporarily unreachable.

## How it works

1. Press the configured hotkey (default **`Ctrl+Shift+R`**) to start recording
   exam-room audio.
2. Press it again to stop. The audio is sent to a configurable AI backend,
   which returns a structured SOAP note (Subjective / Objective / Assessment
   / Plan).
3. If the target practice-management window (AVImark by default) is the
   foreground window, the note is copied to the clipboard and pasted in
   automatically (simulated `Ctrl+V`).
4. If it's *not* focused, a "Safety Flyout" window pops up in the bottom-right
   corner of the screen with the note text and buttons to copy it to the
   clipboard or inject it once you switch back.
5. If the backend call fails (timeout, error response, malformed reply), the
   raw audio is never lost: it's archived to `~/.vetscribe/recordings/` and
   also queued for automatic retry, and a flyout explains what happened. A
   background worker retries queued recordings every 60 seconds and pops up a
   flyout with the recovered note once the backend comes back.

A tray icon shows the current state at a glance: green (idle), red
(recording), yellow (processing). Right-clicking the tray icon opens a menu
with the current status, a way to reopen the last generated note, a Settings
window, and Quit (which cleanly stops the hotkey listener, any in-progress
recording, and the retry-queue worker before exiting).

### Settings

The tray menu's **Settings** window lets you edit, without restarting the
app:

- API Endpoint URL
- API Key / Token (sent as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header)
- Hotkey Combination (rebinds the global hotkey live)
- Target Window Matcher (which window title identifies your practice
  software — defaults to `AVImark`)
- Launch VetScribe on Windows Startup (adds/removes an
  `HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run` registry entry)

Saving writes to `~/.vetscribe/config.json` and applies every change to the
already-running app immediately.

`pywin32`, `pywinauto`, and `winreg` are only meaningfully used on Windows
(`sys_platform == 'win32'` markers in `pyproject.toml`, or stubbed out in
tests via `tests/conftest.py`); the app can be developed and unit/integration
tested on Linux, but AVImark injection and startup registration only run for
real on Windows.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+ and [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tharun-ragu22/vetscribe.git
cd vetscribe
uv sync
```

On Linux, running/testing also needs system packages for audio and Tk:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libportaudio2 python3-tk python3-dev
```

### Configuration

On first run, VetScribe creates `~/.vetscribe/config.json` with defaults
(see `src/vetscribe/config.py`):

```json
{
  "api_endpoint": "https://localhost:8443/api/soap",
  "api_timeout_seconds": 30,
  "hotkey": "<ctrl>+<shift>+r",
  "api_key": "",
  "target_window_matcher": "AVImark",
  "launch_on_startup": false
}
```

All of these fields can also be edited live from the tray's Settings window
(see above) instead of hand-editing the file.

Edit `api_endpoint` to point at your SOAP-note-generation backend. It's
expected to accept a `POST` with raw WAV bytes (`Content-Type: audio/wav`,
plus `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` if `api_key` is set) and return JSON
with `subjective`, `objective`, `assessment`, and `plan` fields.

A reference implementation of this backend, with pluggable OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini
providers for transcription and note generation, lives in [`backend/`](backend/README.md).

### Running

```bash
uv run python -m vetscribe.main
```

This starts the tray icon, registers the global hotkey, configures logging,
and starts the offline-retry background worker.

### Logs

Diagnostic logs (mic start/stop, foreground window checks, backend response
codes, injection success/failure) are written to a rotating log file (5MB per
file, 3 backups kept) at `%APPDATA%\VetScribe\logs\vetscribe.log` on Windows,
or `~/.vetscribe/logs/vetscribe.log` elsewhere. Set the `VETSCRIBE_DEBUG`
environment variable to any truthy value to log at `DEBUG` instead of `INFO`.

.github/workflows/ci.yml  GitHub Actions CI: runs the full suite on ubuntu-latest and
                          windows-latest (via uv), then builds and uploads the Windows
                          executable as a build artifact
```

### Key design points

- **Dependency injection**: `build_app(config=None, tk_root=None)` in
  `main.py` constructs the recorder, API client, injector, pipeline, tray
  app, hotkey listener, and offline queue, so every piece can be swapped for
  a test double.
- **State machine**: `Pipeline` in `pipeline.py` only has three states
  (`IDLE`, `RECORDING`, `PROCESSING`). `toggle_recording()` is a no-op while
  processing, so a stray hotkey press mid-transcription can't corrupt state,
  and a caught backend failure always returns the pipeline to `IDLE` instead
  of stranding it in `PROCESSING`.
- **Injection safety**: `AvimarkInjector.inject()` refuses to send
  `Ctrl+V` unless the configured target window is genuinely the foreground
  window (checked via `win32gui.GetForegroundWindow()`), so a SOAP note can
  never be pasted into the wrong application.
- **No data loss on backend failure**: if `ApiClient.generate_soap_note()`
  raises, `Pipeline` archives the raw WAV to
  `~/.vetscribe/recordings/failed_*.wav`, enqueues it in `OfflineQueue` for
  automatic retry, and surfaces the error via a flyout — the vet is never
  left with a frozen yellow tray icon and no explanation.
- **Live settings, no restart**: `HotkeyListener.update_hotkey()` and direct
  attribute updates on `ApiClient`/`AvimarkInjector` let the Settings window
  apply changes to the already-running process.
- **Mock AVImark for testing**: `tests/acceptance/mock_avimark.py` is a
  Tkinter stand-in for the real AVImark window, used by the Windows
  acceptance tests. Because Tkinter widgets have no native Win32 control
  class, its content can't be read back via GUI automation — instead it
  dumps its text to a file on every edit, which the tests poll and read.

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

On Linux, GUI-touching tests need a display (real or virtual):

```bash
xvfb-run -a uv run pytest -v
```

Windows-only acceptance tests (`tests/acceptance/test_e2e_*.py`) are
automatically skipped on non-Windows platforms and only run for real in CI
on the `windows-latest` runner. Windows-only modules (`winreg`, `pywin32`)
are stubbed out in `tests/conftest.py` on non-Windows platforms so their
call sites can still be imported and exercised with mocks.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` has two jobs:

- **`test`**: runs the full test suite on both `ubuntu-latest` and
  `windows-latest` for every push/PR to `main`, using `uv sync --locked` for
  reproducible installs. This includes the real Windows GUI acceptance tests
  (mock AVImark injection and safety-flyout fallback), so a green run means
  the app has been verified end-to-end on a genuine, fresh Windows machine.
- **`test-backend`**: runs the `backend/` reference server's own test suite
  (`uv sync --locked` + `uv run pytest -v` from within `backend/`) on
  `ubuntu-latest`, independently of the `test` job above — provider calls are
  `respx`-mocked so no real API keys are needed.
- **`build-windows-exe`**: runs after `test` passes, builds a standalone
  `VetScribe` folder with PyInstaller (`build_spec/vetscribe.spec`), and
  uploads it as a workflow artifact. Producing the double-clickable
  `VetScribeSetup.exe` installer additionally requires running Inno Setup
  (`build_spec/installer.iss`) against that build output, which isn't yet
  automated in CI.
