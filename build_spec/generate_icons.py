"""Regenerate the committed VetScribe logo assets from ``vetscribe.icon_art``.

The tray icon is drawn live (its collar colour changes with pipeline state),
but the taskbar/window/exe icon is a static file. This script bakes the
idle-green logo into a multi-resolution Windows ``.ico`` (used by PyInstaller
for the .exe and by Tk for window icons on Windows) and a 256px ``.png`` (used
by Tk's ``iconphoto`` on Linux/macOS).

Run from the repo root:

    uv run python build_spec/generate_icons.py
