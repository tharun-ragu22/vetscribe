"""Give Tk windows the VetScribe dog logo instead of Tk's default feather.

Setting the icon on the root with ``default=True`` is supposed to cascade to
every Toplevel, but in practice new Toplevels (the flyout / settings / history
windows) can still come up with Tk's stock icon, so each window applies it
itself via ``apply_window_icon``.
