class InjectionPoller:
    """Polls the backend for mobile-originated "inject this note into AVImark"
    requests and hands each one to a callback.

    This is the desktop half of the remote-injection bridge. It mirrors
    ``OfflineQueue``: a daemon thread polls on an interval (default 3s, far
    tighter than the offline queue's 60s because the vet is waiting at the PC),
    and network failures are swallowed so a flaky backend just means the next
    poll retries.

    Threading: this runs on a background thread, but ``on_injection`` almost
    certainly needs to touch Tk (show a flyout) or Win32 (paste), so the wiring
    in ``main.py`` marshals it onto the main thread via ``run_on_main_thread``.
    Because that dispatch is asynchronous, we can't learn the real paste outcome
    here, so we ack with ``"delivered"`` — the ack only means "the desktop
    received this request", which is what stops it being re-delivered.

    Each request is dispatched exactly once: once we've handed a request id to
    ``on_injection`` we record it in ``_handled`` and never dispatch it again,
    even if the ack call fails and the backend keeps returning it — re-pasting
    the same note into a chart is worse than dropping a lost ack. A request that
    fails to dispatch (the callback raised) is *not* recorded, so it retries."""
