# VetScribe Backend (reference implementation)

A minimal reference server that satisfies the HTTP contract VetScribe's `ApiClient` expects
(`POST /api/soap` with raw WAV bytes, returns JSON with `subjective`/`objective`/`assessment`/`plan`).
It's a separate project from the desktop tray app — this is meant to run on a server (or locally for
development), not ship inside the Windows installer.

Transcription and SOAP-note generation are each behind a small interface, selected independently, so
you can mix providers (e.g. Gemini for transcription, Anthropic for note generation):

| Env var | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `VETSCRIBE_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` | `openai`, `gemini` | `openai` |
| `VETSCRIBE_NOTE_PROVIDER` | `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `ollama` | `openai` |

Provider credentials (only the ones for your selected providers are required):

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI Whisper transcription and/or GPT note generation |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude note generation |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini transcription and/or note generation |
| `OPENAI_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` | default `whisper-1` |
| `OPENAI_NOTE_MODEL` | default `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `ANTHROPIC_NOTE_MODEL` | default `claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| `GEMINI_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` | default `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `GEMINI_NOTE_MODEL` | default `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | self-hosted Ollama server, default `http://localhost:11434` (no API key needed) |
| `OLLAMA_NOTE_MODEL` | default `gemma4:e4b` |

`VETSCRIBE_BACKEND_API_KEY` is a separate shared secret (distinct from the provider keys above): if
set, incoming requests must send `Authorization: Bearer <that value>` — this is the value you'd put in
VetScribe's own "API Key" setting. If unset, the backend accepts unauthenticated requests.

### Using a `.env` file

Instead of exporting all of the above as real environment variables, copy `.env.example` to `.env` in
`backend/` and fill in the values there:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your provider choice and API key(s)
uv run python -m vetscribe_backend.main
```

`BackendConfig.from_env()` loads `.env` automatically (via `python-dotenv`) on startup. Real environment
variables still take precedence over `.env` values if both are set. `.env` is gitignored — never commit
it.

The SOAP-note system prompt sent to whichever note-generation provider is selected lives in
`src/vetscribe_backend/prompts.py` (`SOAP_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) — edit it there if you want to change the
clinical instructions given to the model.

## Running

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
VETSCRIBE_NOTE_PROVIDER=anthropic ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
VETSCRIBE_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
  uv run python -m vetscribe_backend.main
```

Listens on port 8443 by default (override with `PORT`), matching VetScribe's default
`api_endpoint` of `https://localhost:8443/api/soap` — note this runs plain HTTP, so for local dev
point VetScribe's Settings at `http://localhost:8443/api/soap`, or put a TLS-terminating proxy in
front of it for anything beyond local testing.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest -v
```

All provider HTTP calls are mocked with `respx` in tests — no real API keys or network calls are
needed to run the suite.

## Evals

`evals/` (separate from `tests/`, not picked up by `pytest`) holds `pydantic-evals`-based evals for
`NoteGenerator.generate()` against a range of example transcripts (`evals/cases.py`) — routine visits,
emergencies, multi-pet visits, vague/garbled transcripts, declined-care conversations, and irrelevant
chit-chat mixed in with a real complaint. Unlike the unit tests, these make real network calls to a live
Ollama-compatible server, scoring output with deterministic checks (all four SOAP fields present,
expected keywords per case) plus an `LLMJudge` rubric for faithfulness/hallucination, correct SOAP
categorization, and ignoring irrelevant chatter — judged by the same Ollama model, so no paid API key is
needed:

```bash
cd backend
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 OLLAMA_NOTE_MODEL=gemma4:e4b \
  uv run python -m evals.note_generator_evals
```

Point `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` at any reachable Ollama server (e.g. a tunnel to a GPU box) and
`OLLAMA_NOTE_MODEL` at whatever's pulled there. Both default to `BackendConfig`'s own Ollama defaults
(`http://localhost:11434` / `gemma4:e4b`) if unset. A case counts as passing only if it didn't error
and every assertion (`HasAllSoapFields`, `LLMJudge`) is true; `note_generator_evals.main()` exits
non-zero unless at least `REQUIRED_PASS_RATE` (70%) of cases pass, so it works as a CI gate without
requiring a perfect run from a small local model.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `backend-evals` job runs this in CI on `ubuntu-latest`, after
`test-backend`'s deterministic suite passes and before `build-windows-exe`: it installs Ollama, pulls
`gemma4:e4b`, and runs the same command against `localhost:11434`. Since these are CPU-only GitHub-hosted
runners (no GPU), and Ollama serializes generation per model anyway, the eval runner processes cases one
at a time with a generous `OLLAMA_EVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300s) rather than the provider's normal
120s default — expect the CI job to take tens of minutes, not seconds.

The job only runs when a push/PR touches backend code (gated by the `changes` job at the top of the
workflow, via `dorny/paths-filter` on `backend/**`, excluding `*.md` files) — it's skipped for
tray-app-only or docs-only changes, since it's the slowest job in the pipeline and gains nothing from
re-running against unchanged eval-relevant code.
`build-windows-exe` accounts for this by treating `backend-evals` being skipped the same as it succeeding.
