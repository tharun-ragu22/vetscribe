    # icon.run()/run_detached() and lets it exit. Every test that builds a
    # TrayApp (directly, or via build_app()) without running that loop leaks
    # its class for the rest of the process. Once CPython reuses a
    # garbage-collected Icon's address for a later Icon, RegisterClassEx
    # collides on the same class name and raises "OSError: [WinError 1410]
    # Class already exists" -- nondeterministically, depending on GC timing.

    # A post-test gc.get_objects() sweep can't catch these: CPython frees an
    # Icon via refcounting the instant a test function's local variable goes
    # out of scope, well before this fixture's teardown runs, so by then the
    # object (and any way to reach its atom) is already gone. Instead, wrap
    # Icon.__init__ to record every instance *as it's constructed*, holding a
    # strong reference until teardown explicitly unregisters its class --
    # only then do we drop the reference and let it be collected normally.
